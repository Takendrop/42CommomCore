## Projects

### Libft
**Libft** is a custom implementation of standard C library functions. This project is the foundation for many other projects and helps in understanding the inner workings of these functions.

### Born2beroot
**Born2beroot** is a system administration project that involves setting up and securing a virtual server. It covers basic Linux command-line operations and server management.

### ft_printf
**ft_printf** is a custom implementation of the C library's `printf` function. This project covers variadic functions and formatted output.

### Get_Next_Line
**Get_Next_Line** is a function to read a line from a file descriptor. This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation and efficient file I/O operations.

### Minitalk
**Minitalk** is a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It consists of a client and a server where the client sends a string to the server, one character at a time. This project demonstrates inter-process communication (IPC) and signal handling in C.

### Push_swap
**Push_swap** is an algorithmic project focused on sorting data on a stack with a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort a stack of integers in as few moves as possible using only specified operations. This project emphasizes problem-solving, algorithm optimization, and stack manipulation.

### So Long
**So Long** is a simple 2D game developed using the MiniLibX library. This project introduces basic game development concepts and graphical programming.
