# 42CommomCore

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing various projects developed during my time at the 42 Warsaw Campus.
These projects are mainly written in C adn C++ and showcase different aspects of programming and algorithm development learned throughout the curriculum.

Projects:

Libft
A custom implementation of standard C library functions. This project is the foundation for many other projects and helps in understanding the inner workings of these functions.

Born2beroot
A system administration project that involves setting up and securing a virtual server. It covers basic Linux command-line operations and server management.

ft_printf
A custom implementation of the C library's printf function. This project covers variadic functions and formatted output.

Get_Next_Line
A function to read a line from a file descriptor. This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation and efficient file I/O operations.

mini_talk
Small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It consists of a client and a server where the client sends a string to the server, one character at a time. This project demonstrates inter-process communication (IPC) and signal handling in C.

push_swap
Algorithmic project focused on sorting data on a stack with a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort a stack of integers in as few moves as possible using only specified operations. This project emphasizes problem-solving, algorithm optimization, and stack manipulation.

so_long
A simple 2D game developed using the MiniLibX library. This project introduces basic game development concepts and graphical programming.
